 * natcasesort ( array &$array ) : bool
 *
 * Is a case insensitive version of natsort().
 * This function implements a sort algorithm that orders alphanumeric strings in the way a human being would while
 * maintaining key/value associations. This is described as a "natural ordering".
 * NOTE: If two members compare as equal, their relative order in the sorted array is undefined.
